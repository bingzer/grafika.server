        <p>
            Grafika uses JSON as the data structure for the animation.<br />
            There are two types of animations:
            <a href="#private">Private</a> and <a href="#public">Public</a><br />
        </p>

                <h3>Private Animations</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                Private animations can only be viewed, play and shared by the owner.<br />
                Since this type of animation is only available to you, the commenting
                service will not be available.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the owner of this animation, you can make change a private animation
                to be a public by changing the <code>isPublic</code> flag.<br />
                Doing this will allow the animation to be accessible by everyone else.

                <h3>Public Animations</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
                Public animations can be viewed, play and shared by anyone accessing the system.
                By marking an animation public, you (as an author of that animation) are granting
                everyone else a view access to your animation.
